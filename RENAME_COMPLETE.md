## What Changed

**OLD:** `adjacent-unit-combiner/`
- Name implied single-purpose tool
- Misleading (adjacent units is 1 of 6 strategies)

**NEW:** `rough-quarters/` 💎🏠
- Pun: "Diamond in the rough" + "Living quarters"
- Captures multi-strategy discovery concept
- Professional, memorable, brandable

---

## Files Updated

✅ **Directory renamed:** `/Users/pjump/Desktop/projects/rough-quarters/`

✅ **README.md** - New intro:
```
# Rough Quarters
Finding diamond apartments in the rough

An autonomous discovery engine that finds exceptional places to live
by analyzing 571K+ NYC buildings...
```

✅ **IDEA-CARD.md** - Replaced with v2:
- Old version saved as `IDEA-CARD-v1-original.md`
- New version shows full evolution
- Updated title: "Rough Quarters: Finding Diamond Apartments in the Rough"

✅ **Claude project info** - Updated `.claude/project-info.md`

---

## What Stayed the Same

All functionality intact:
- ✅ `diamond-finder/` directory (the discovery engine)
- ✅ All 6 strategies still working
- ✅ Database: 157 diamonds preserved
- ✅ Data sources all connected
- ✅ `run.py` still works exactly the same

**Just renamed the parent directory and updated documentation!**

## New Identity

**Name:** Rough Quarters

**Tagline:** *"Finding diamond apartments in the rough"*

**What it does:**
Autonomous discovery engine analyzing 571K+ buildings to find exceptional homes - whether they're available or not.

**Perfect pun:**
- "Diamond in the rough" (hidden gems)
- "Living quarters" (apartments)
- Both meanings captured!

---

## Quick Test

```bash
cd /Users/pjump/Desktop/projects/rough-quarters/diamond-finder
python3 run.py all
```

Should work exactly as before, just cleaner branding!

## Git Update (If Needed)

If this is tracked in git:
```bash
cd /Users/pjump/Desktop/projects/rough-quarters
git add -A
git commit -m "Rename project to rough-quarters

- Rename from adjacent-unit-combiner (misleading single-purpose name)
- New name captures multi-strategy discovery concept
- Pun: diamond in rough + living quarters
- Updated README.md and IDEA-CARD.md
- All functionality preserved, just better branding"
```

## The Vision

From original idea:
> "Find adjacent units you can combine"

To what we built:
> "Autonomous discovery engine finding diamonds in the rough through 6+ strategies across 571K buildings"

**Now the name matches the vision!** 🎯

**Rough Quarters** is ready to keep discovering. 💎🏠
