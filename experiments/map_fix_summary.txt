MAP "MISSING MARKERS" ISSUE - SOLVED
====================================

WHAT YOU NOTICED:
The map appeared to be missing many markers - you saw ~377 markers but expected 1,183.

THE REAL ISSUE:
The map wasn't broken - it was showing ONE marker per building, but many buildings 
have MULTIPLE adjacent pair combinations!

THE DATA:
- 1,183 total adjacent pairs with geocoded addresses
- But only 377 unique building locations  
- That means 806 pairs were "hidden" because they share buildings with other pairs

EXAMPLES OF BUILDINGS WITH MANY PAIRS:
- 255 E 77th St: 121 different pair combinations (!)
- 201 E 23rd St: 118 different pair combinations
- 815 Broadway: 47 different pair combinations
- 643 5th Ave (Brooklyn): 31 different pair combinations

This makes sense! A large apartment building with many units will have lots of 
different ways to combine adjacent units.

THE FIX:
✅ Map now groups pairs by building location
✅ One marker per building (cleaner map)
✅ Marker size scales with # of opportunities (bigger = more pairs)
✅ Click any marker to see ALL pairs at that building
✅ Popups show top 5 pairs + count of remaining
✅ Pairs sorted by savings (best deals first)
✅ New info display: "377 locations (1,183 pairs, 806 grouped)"

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:
- Cleaner map - no overlapping markers
- Easy to see which buildings have the MOST opportunities (bigger markers)
- Click any marker to browse ALL pair combinations at that location
- Focus on buildings with lots of pairs = more flexibility in choosing units
